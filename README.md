## Project Brief

For the scope of this project, it is essential that the development of a CRUD application be accompied by a Kanban board featuring user stories, user cases and tasks needing to complete the project. The application must have a relational databases with at least 2 tables. The scope also sets the requirement for clear documentation with regards to the design phase ensuring the architecture is given in as much detail as possible. Furthermore, test suites for the application must be written and documented to provide as much coverage as possible, this will provide consistency of the software. Accompanying the back-end CRUD features, it will also have to be brought to life with a front-end website and integrated API's via Flask. The entire project must be fully integrated with version control and the server must be deployed to a cloud-based VM.

## Introduction

To meet the project brief set out, I will be developing an online web application to create, retrive, update and delete recipes and a recipe will contain 1 or more ingredients. Throughout the duration of the project I will be creating a risk assessment for the project brief. I will also be completing designs for the database architecture which will be implemented into the application, the application development will also be documented with tests to ensure continuous testing is followed. With efficient project management, I plan to increase the applications functionality by adding employees and an ordering system.
